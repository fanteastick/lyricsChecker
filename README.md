# lyricsChecker
A checker idea for lyrics that I thought of

The plan: 
>User starts sequence
>Program starts
>User inputs song lyrics
>User inputs a word
>User keeps putting in words until user says "END"
>Program searches lyrics for the words
>Program will return how many times each individual word is found, and how many total times the words were found
>Program ends


Future plans: 
>Have a version where it's reversed. First put in the words, and then put in a bunch of different song lyrics.
  >should be able to differentiate each song with cool formatting
>put it together with a website
>figure out heroku
>learn how to make pull requests through terminal
